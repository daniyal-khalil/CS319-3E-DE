The Gameplay is also not restricted to the same Arcade game from the 1980s it has been made more interesting and enticing than its previous version. The gameplay is as follows: the user is in control of a shooting character or object (for example an Avenger) and is trying to defend the people from an alien or monster invasion, depending upon the theme settings. The user can control the object by making it go either up, down, left or right on a navigation screen. While moving here and there the user can shoot projectiles in the direction of the invaders which will defeat them. Meanwhile, the invaders can also fire projectiles at the user, and after a certain amount of hits the user dies and it is game over. The invaders can also pick up the spectators hence saving those who are being kidnapped would yield different kinds of rewards. These rewards will also be given as loot boxes by killing random invaders. The game would inquire a user to make profile upon entering the game, and the details of the profile will be saved in a text file beforehand. The profile can be used to save various data such as previous scores and items gained. The players can gain coins by killing invaders. The coins can be used to buy in-game items from a shop. The shop will contain various types of boosts and weapons and special items. The game will maintain a high score of the previous player to increase the competitiveness.
